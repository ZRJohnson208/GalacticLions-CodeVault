# Galactic Lions TeamCode - 2025-2026 Season
**Welcome to the Lakeview Robotics Code Respiratory! This space is primarily built for our dedicated programmers of our teams.**

This is a module that contains the Android Studio projects with code for our robotics teams' FTC robots for the (NAME) competition season. It's based on the [original FTC SDK](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController). While meant primarily for our teams' members, [this respiratory](https://github.com/ftcteam5898/GalacticLions-Starter) should be welcoming to contributions from external organizations and FTC community.

## Requirements

To use this Android Studio project, you will need Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2) or later.

To program your robot in Blocks or OnBot Java, you do not need Android Studio.

## Getting Started

For those new to the robot programming space or robotics, it is higly recommended to review the [FTC Block Code](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html) to get familiar with the robot coding language and the control system. This may also apply to returning team programmers.

When you are ready to program in Java, you can download the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAzvC9BhADEiwAEhtlN1GO7x4DcoMQ9Q-BR-_y67NSKy9FjMK88L6woepRECnAuXiWYT9yrRoCiA4QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) or use the OnBot Java Tool.

## Questions or Need Help?
Please ask/email one of the coaches or your team captain. You can also check the [FTC Documentation](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/).
